1.what are block  elements?

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

3.Have you used PreCSS? What is it?
No,
Use Sass-like markup in your CSS. It combines Sass-like syntactical sugar — like variables, conditionals,
and iterators — with emerging CSS features — like logical and custom properties, media query ranges, and image sets. 
Stylus and PreCSS belong to "CSS Pre-processors / Extensions" category of the tech stack.

4.What is the difference between Margin and Padding?

• Padding is the space between the border and the content while margin is the space outside the border.

• Padding separates the content of a block from the border. The margin separates one block from the other.

• Padding consists of the background images and background colors applied to content while the margin does not content such.

• Margins of adjacent blocks can overlap while padding does not overlap.

the margin indicates the area outside the border and the padding indicates the area inside the border.


========================================================================================================================================================
4.Is padding included in the element?

Padding and Element Width The CSS width property specifies the width of the element's content area. 
The content area is the portion inside the padding, border, and margin of an element (the box model). 
So, if an element has a specified width, the padding added to that element will be added to the total width of the element.
========================================================================================================================================================
5.What types of selectors are used in css?

A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) for styling purpose. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.

There are many basic different types of selectors.

Element Selector
Id Selector
Class Selector
Universal Selector
Group Selector

1. Element selector: The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name (or tag) for example p, h1, div, span, etc.
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
2. Id selector: The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

Note: An id of element is unique on a page to use id selector.
3. class-selector: The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
4. universal-selector: The * selector in CSS is used to select all the elements in a HTML document. It also selects all elements which are inside under another element.
5. Group-selector: This selector is used to style all comma separated elements with the same style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

6.What are the available values for property "position"?

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
=======================================================================================================================================================
7.What happens when you use each value?

static	         Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow	

absolute	The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.With absolute positioning, an element can be placed anywhere on a page.
	
fixed	        The element is positioned relative to the browser window
	
relative	The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position	

sticky	         The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).

8.How can I show 2 div tag elements side by side?

3 ways to display two divs side by side
1.The most common and traditional way (inline-block)
2.Float Method
3.Grid

9.Explain the term responsive web design?

Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize a website.

Responsive Web Design is about making a website look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):
When making responsive web pages, add the following <meta> element to all your web pages:

Example
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Media Queries plays an important role in responsive web pages.

With media queries you can define different styles for different browser sizes.

Example:
Resize the browser window to see that the three elements below will display horizontally on large screens and vertically on small screens:

==========================================================================================================================================================
10.What is css flexbox?
The CSS3 flexbox is used to make the elements behave predictably when they are used with different screen sizes and different display devices.
 It provides a more efficient way to layout, align and distribute space among items in the container.

It is mainly used to make CSS3 capable to change its item?s width and height to best fit for all available spaces. It is preferred over block model.

The CSS3 flexbox contains flex containers and flex items.
==========================================================================================================================================================

11.What is css opacity?

The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element.

The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent.

12.when click on button u need to scroll to the particular div using HTML?

<a href="#top">Top</a>
<a href="#middle">Middle</a>
<a href="#bottom">Bottom</a>
<div id="top"><a href="top"></a>Top</div>
<div id="middle"><a href="middle"></a>Middle</div>
<div id="bottom"><a href="bottom"></a>Bottom</div>
CSS

#top,#middle,#bottom{
    height: 600px;
    width: 300px;
    background: green; 
}

13.What is specificity in CSS?

If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", 
and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.

Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration are ultimately applied to an element.
Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
IDs - Example: #navbar
Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, :before

=============================================================================================================================================================
14.What is Flexbox?

CSS Flexible Layout Box, popularly known as Flexbox is a powerful one-dimensional layout model.
 It helps to lay, align and distribute items (children) efficiently inside a container (parent).  

Important Features:

One-dimensional layout model: Flex is a one-dimensional layout model as it can only deal with items either horizontally as rows or vertically as columns.
 On the contrary, the CSS Grid layout can handle rows and columns together.

Creates flexible and responsive layouts: Flexbox gives flex container the ability to customize the items within it, depending on different screen sizes.
 A flex container can expand its children’s items to fill the available space or it can also shrink them to prevent overflow.

Direction-agnostic: Flexbox is free from any directional constraints unlike Block (vertically biased) and Inline (horizontally biased).
Super easy to use: It is easy to align items in Flexbox, unlike using float and positioning which are a little frustrating and sometimes difficult to use.
